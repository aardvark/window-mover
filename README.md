# C# window manipulation app

This app exists as a process of checking some ideas 
for doing tiling window manager under W10. 

Current approach is just to get Window handle and 
manipulate it via WinAPI (user32.dll) bindings. 

Hopefully tile arrangement of window will also work.
But this is for the future to show

# Build
